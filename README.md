# Course Portfolio
### All the projects in this repository are just a few of the tasks I completed during a data science bootcamp using pythom. These are the larger programs i built after multiple smaller tasks learning the basics in each specific field I then put what i learnt into each of these projects over the course of my time studying ###
#Datasets tasks was my first attempt at using jupyter notebook then coding python to read datasets to analyse the data and draw scatterplot graphs then use predictive models to draw future trend lines. #
# Defensive programming task was to showcase the defensive programming i had learnt to counteract possible errors occuring. #
# Finance Calculators task i was given the intructiom to build a program that would allow the user to choose either an investment to work out how much they could earn dependant of how much deposit they put down and the duration of investment, Or they could choose bond to see how much they would repay on a home loan dependant on deposit, duration and interest rate.#
Holiday comparison search task was creating exactly that. The user selects destination, hotel, duration, flights, hire car to work out their total holiday cost. #
Minesweeper was a fun task to really test my skills learnt. #
